Executive Summary

We propose a Python-based solution leveraging FastAPI for the REST API and Typer (or Click) for the CLI. Python is widely used for web scraping due to its readability and rich ecosystem of libraries (e.g. Requests/HTTPX, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
oxylabs.io
scrapingant.com
. For fetching pages we recommend an asynchronous HTTP client (HTTPX or aiohttp) for high concurrency, with BeautifulSoup (or lxml) for HTML parsing and Playwright for JavaScript-heavy sites
medium.com
scrapfly.io
. The architecture follows an “MCP server” model: a FastAPI server accepts jobs (via POST) and queues them for background workers, enabling non-blocking job handling. Jobs can also be run directly via a CLI (mcp_scraper.py). Results are saved as JSON files in a configurable output directory. This design meets local-only constraints, supports single or batch URLs (--url or --list-file), handles dynamic content, and provides an interactive API (status checks, result downloads) for AI agents.
1. Core Technology Stack Analysis
1.1 Programming Language

We choose Python 3.x as the implementation language. Python is a de facto standard for web scraping: it is easy to learn, has extensive libraries (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, etc.), and strong community support
oxylabs.io
. Its async capabilities (asyncio) allow high concurrency for I/O-bound tasks
geeksforgeeks.org
. Alternatives like JavaScript/Node (with Puppeteer) or Go exist, but Python’s readability, rapid development, and unification of CLI and API in one language make it ideal. Python’s popularity in AI (for downstream agents) is another advantage.
1.2 HTTP & Parsing Libraries

For HTTP requests, we compare:

    requests (synchronous, ubiquitous) – easy to use and beginner-friendly
    scrapingant.com
    , but limited to one request at a time and no HTTP/2 support
    scrapingant.com
    oxylabs.io
    .

    httpx – a modern, drop-in Requests alternative with sync/async modes and HTTP/2 support. HTTPX is well-suited for high-concurrency, performance-critical apps
    scrapingant.com
    and supports async/await and connection pooling. In benchmarks, HTTPX outperforms Requests under load
    scrapingant.com
    . It makes code easy to upgrade to async while retaining a familiar API.

    aiohttp – a pure async HTTP client/framework. AIOHTTP is performant for high concurrency
    oxylabs.io
    , but is async-only and a bit lower-level. HTTPX (async mode) is more feature-rich (HTTP/2) and can also run synchronously if needed.
    We recommend HTTPX (with async client) for flexible sync/async usage; use Requests only for simple scripts or where sync suffices.

For HTML parsing, options include:

    BeautifulSoup (bs4) – very easy to use and robust against malformed HTML
    medium.com
    . Great for beginners and most use cases.

    lxml – faster and supports XPath, built on C libraries
    medium.com
    . Offers a good speed/features balance.

    Selectolax – ultra-fast (written in C), but less well-known.
    For general scraping, BeautifulSoup with the ‘lxml’ parser is recommended for clarity and compatibility
    medium.com
    . If performance is critical, we could parse with lxml.etree directly.

For JavaScript-heavy pages, both Requests and Scrapy fail
medium.com
. We will integrate a headless browser (Playwright or Selenium) to render and scrape dynamic content. Playwright (Python) is the modern choice: it supports async execution and multiple browsers, and benchmarks show it often outperforms Selenium
scrapfly.io
scrapfly.io
.
1.3 API Server Framework

We select FastAPI as the REST framework. FastAPI is a modern ASGI framework built on Starlette, known for very high performance (comparable to Go/Node) and built-in validation and OpenAPI docs
fastapi.tiangolo.com
. Its async-first design makes it well-suited for I/O-bound tasks (such as awaiting scrapes)
medium.com
fastapi.tiangolo.com
. Benchmarks consistently show FastAPI handling more requests per second and lower resource usage than Flask in concurrent scenarios
medium.com
fastapi.tiangolo.com
. Alternative frameworks like Flask (WSGI, synchronous) or Django REST Framework (heavy, sync) lack async, which would bottleneck long-running scrape jobs
medium.com
. FastAPI also automatically generates API docs (Swagger), aiding AI agents. We will use Uvicorn/Gunicorn as the ASGI server.
1.4 CLI Framework

For the command-line interface (mcp_scraper.py), we can use:

    Argparse (Python stdlib) – no external deps, robust for simple flags and subcommands
    pythonsnacks.com
    . Good if we want zero-install.

    Click – popular, decorator-based CLI framework. Generates nice help pages and handles complex commands cleanly
    pythonsnacks.com
    . Slightly more modern than argparse.

    Typer – built on Click, designed like “FastAPI for CLIs” (uses type hints)
    fastapi.tiangolo.com
    . Offers very concise code with auto-completion.
    For flexibility and developer ergonomics, Typer (or Click) is recommended. Typer’s type-hint approach reduces boilerplate and is ideal for medium complexity (one URL or list) while argparse is perfectly viable for minimal scripts
    pythonsnacks.com
    pythonsnacks.com
    . Typer/Click yield self-documenting commands and easy parsing of options (--url, --list-file, --output-dir).

2. Architectural Design – “MCP Server” Model
2.1 Overall Architecture

The MCP server consists of a job submission interface (CLI or API), a job queue/scheduler, and worker processes that perform scraping. The server has these components:

    Interface Layer: FastAPI endpoints (e.g. POST /scrape) and a CLI frontend (mcp_scraper.py) parse inputs and create jobs. These convert inputs (URL or list file) into job requests.

    Job Manager / Scheduler: Upon submission, jobs are assigned a unique ID and placed in a queue (e.g. an in-memory queue or database table). This decouples request handling from execution (non-blocking API).

    Worker Pool: One or more worker threads or async tasks take jobs from the queue. Each worker instantiates the scraper logic: fetch the target(s) (via HTTPX or Playwright), parse results, and write output. Using Python’s asyncio/event loop allows concurrency (many HTTP fetches) even within one process
    geeksforgeeks.org
    . If using Playwright for JS pages, each job may use a separate browser instance or context.

    Result Store: Completed results are saved as JSON files in the configured output directory (<OUTPUT_DIR>/<job_id>.json) and the job status is updated (e.g. to “completed”). An in-memory or small local DB tracks job metadata (ID, status, timestamps, file paths).

    Status/Results API: FastAPI endpoints allow clients to query job status or download results. For example, GET /status/{job_id} and GET /results/{job_id}. This layer reads from the job store or file system.

    JobDB -->|"GET /jobs"| APIClient

2.2 API Endpoints

The FastAPI server exposes endpoints for job management. Example spec:

    POST /scrape – Submit a new scraping job. Accepts JSON body:

    {
      "input_type": "url"|"file",
      "target": "<URL or file path>",
      "output_dir": "<path>"
    }

    Returns: {"job_id": "<unique_id>", "status": "queued"}. The server validates input, enqueues the job, and immediately returns. (Async background tasks handle the scrape.)

    GET /status/{job_id} – Query job status. Returns JSON: {"job_id": "...", "status": "queued"|"running"|"completed"|"failed"} (plus optional metadata like timestamp).

    GET /results/{job_id} – Retrieve completed results. If done, returns the JSON result (with Content-Disposition: attachment for download), e.g. the scraped data. If not ready, returns an appropriate error (e.g. 404 or status message).

    GET /jobs – (Optional) List recent jobs and statuses. Returns an array of {job_id, status, source_url, scrape_timestamp, ...}.

Each endpoint uses Pydantic models to validate inputs/responses. Jobs run in background tasks (via BackgroundTasks or an async queue) so the API remains non-blocking.
2.3 Data Flow

    Submission: Client (CLI or API call) triggers a scrape.

    Queueing: The server generates a UUID for the job, records its entry (status = queued, target URL), and enqueues it.

    Processing: A worker dequeues a job, updates status to running, and executes the scraper logic:

        Fetch: Use HTTPX (async) or Playwright to retrieve page(s). For a list-file job, the worker iterates over URLs (possibly concurrently).

        Parse: Extract desired data (e.g. via BeautifulSoup).

        Save: Format the data as JSON and write result.json under the output directory (e.g. <OUTPUT_DIR>/<job_id>.json). The sample output is a JSON object containing job_id, source_url, scrape_timestamp, status, and data array.

    Completion: Worker marks the job completed. Clients can now fetch results. The server may also log the completion time, errors if any, etc.

By decoupling submission and execution, the server can handle many jobs in parallel without blocking. Python’s asyncio allows each worker to use await when fetching, maximizing throughput for I/O-bound loads
geeksforgeeks.org
.
3. Feature Implementation Details
3.1 Input Handling

    CLI: We define a command (e.g. scrape) that accepts either --url <URL> or --list-file <path> (JSON or CSV). The CLI verifies arguments: exactly one of URL or list-file must be provided. If a list file is given, the program reads it (using Python’s json module or csv module) to extract a list of URLs. For JSON, expect [{"url": "..."}] format (as in the sample). For CSV, skip header and read the url column.

    API: The /scrape endpoint’s Pydantic model has fields input_type (enum "url" or "file"), target, and output_dir. For input_type="url", target is a string URL; for "file", target is a filesystem path (server-side path to a JSON/CSV). The API verifies existence and format of the file if needed.

Uniform parsing code can be encapsulated in helper functions. If a list of URLs is obtained, either treat it as a single job (aggregating results under one job_id), or create multiple subjobs. For simplicity, we assume one job may handle multiple URLs sequentially. The code should handle invalid URLs gracefully (e.g. skip or log).
3.2 Output Management

Results are written to the --output-dir specified by the user (default ./scrapes_out). The directory is created if it doesn’t exist. Each job writes a JSON file (e.g. {output_dir}/{job_id}.json) containing the result schema:

{
  "job_id": "9b5328c8",
  "source_url": "https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
  "scrape_timestamp": "2025-07-02T11:14:23Z",
  "status": "completed",
  "data": [ ... ]
}

If multiple URLs are scraped in one job, we could output an array of such objects or combine them; design choice. (Alternatively, submit each URL as a separate job for clarity.) The JSON is formatted for ease of use by downstream agents. Raw HTML or logs could also be saved optionally, but for brevity we output only structured data.

Filename collisions are avoided by using the unique job ID. The CLI/API should also support reading and writing to an output subdirectory per job if desired. Errors during scraping (timeout, parse failure) should be captured: the output JSON can include "status": "failed" and an error message, or the job status can be updated to failed. Logging of errors is essential (using Python’s logging module or a monitoring tool).
3.3 Configuration

The tool accepts command-line flags and API parameters:

    --url <URL> or --list-file <file> (JSON/CSV)

    --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> (default ./scrapes_out)

    Optional: --concurrency <N> to set how many simultaneous fetches (threads or async tasks) per job.

    Optional: --headless or --browser to configure Playwright (e.g. use Chromium vs Firefox).

    Environment or config file can hold defaults (e.g. default user-agent string, timeout values). One could use a YAML/INI config or environment variables (with python-dotenv) for advanced settings (e.g. proxy list).

The FastAPI server itself could have settings (host, port, etc) via CLI or env vars. The job queue and data directory paths are configurable. Documentation (README) should clearly list these options.
4. Robustness & Best Practices
4.1 Error Handling

We must handle errors at every stage. Best practices include:

    Validation: Immediately check input (valid URL format, file exists, output dir writable). Return clear errors for bad requests.

    Try/Except: Wrap network and parsing logic in try/except blocks. Catch requests.RequestException or HTTPX errors, parse errors, etc. On failure, log the exception and mark the job failed.

    Retries: Implement retry logic for transient errors. Using libraries like tenacity allows exponential backoff. For example, retry a GET up to 5 times with increasing delays
    scrapingant.com
    . This handles temporary network timeouts or 5xx responses gracefully.

    Timeouts: Set reasonable timeouts on HTTP requests or Playwright navigation to avoid hanging.

    Resource cleanup: Ensure browser sessions are closed after use. In case of exceptions, use finally blocks to quit the driver or context.

    Logging & Monitoring: Use Python’s logging for info and error logs. (For production, one could integrate Sentry or another error tracker.)

    Custom Exceptions: Optionally define a hierarchy (e.g. NetworkError, ParseError) to categorize failures
    scrapingant.com
    , though not strictly required.

    Status Updates: Update job status on start, success, or failure so clients see real-time info.

scrapingant.com
notes: “Implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff is an advanced technique to handle transient errors” – use this to make scrapes more reliable under flaky conditions.
4.2 Anti-Scraping Countermeasures

To minimize blocks and be polite:

    User-Agent Rotation: Do not use a default UA. Rotate through a list of common browser UA strings every few requests (or per job) to mimic different clients.

    Robots.txt: Respecting robots.txt is considered polite. Our tool should optionally check robots.txt of target domains. If the site disallows crawling of the given paths, we either skip or warn the user. Some sites specify Crawl-delay; for example, Reddit’s robots.txt suggests a 5-second delay
    rostrum.blog
    . Implement a default delay (e.g. 1–2 seconds) between requests, or adjust based on robots.txt if available.

    Rate Limiting: Limit requests per domain. Use delays or async semaphores to cap concurrency. Overloading a server can lead to IP bans.

    Proxies: For serious anti-bot environments, support using an HTTP/S proxy or SOCKS proxy (configurable). This is optional but should be architecturally possible (pass proxy settings to HTTPX or Playwright).

    Handling CAPTCHAs/IP-blocks: If encountered, log and abort. Advanced solutions (automated CAPTCHA solvers) are out of scope.

    Headless Detection: When using Playwright, consider stealth plugins or disabling automation flags if needed, as some sites detect headless browsers.

    Session Persistence: Manage cookies or sessions to avoid repeated sign-ins, if scraping multiple pages of the same site.

By default, at least use a custom User-Agent header (like a modern browser string) and moderate rate of requests. These are standard anti-scraping countermeasures; implementing them increases robustness of the scraper.
4.3 Concurrency

Scraping is largely I/O-bound (network and waiting for JavaScript). We use Python’s async features and/or threading:

    AsyncIO: Using async functions with HTTPX or Playwright allows a single thread to handle many simultaneous fetches
    geeksforgeeks.org
    . This is efficient and conserves resources. For example, we can await multiple page GETs with asyncio.gather().

    Threading: If using requests (sync) or blocking code, a thread pool can parallelize tasks. However, Python’s GIL means CPU-bound work isn’t sped up by threads
    geeksforgeeks.org
    , but here IO will release the GIL, so threads can improve throughput.

    Worker Pool: The server can spawn multiple worker processes (via Gunicorn workers or a process pool) if needed for high throughput. Each worker runs its own event loop.

    Concurrency Limits: Configure a maximum number of concurrent jobs and concurrent requests per job to avoid resource exhaustion. For example, if running on a 4-core machine, limit to 4 parallel browser instances or use 4 worker processes.

    Non-blocking API: FastAPI (ASGI) inherently handles many connections concurrently, and our background task model ensures requests return quickly
    medium.com
    .

In summary, we lean on async I/O to maximize scraping throughput. As GfG notes, “asyncio utilizes a single-threaded event loop ... efficiently manage many simultaneous I/O operations”
geeksforgeeks.org
. We may also use threads or multiprocessing for tasks like CPU-bound parsing or if mixing sync libraries, but primarily asyncio should suffice.
5. Final Recommendation & Synthesis
5.1 Recommended Stack

    Language: Python 3.9+ – for ecosystem and AI friendliness.

    HTTP client: HTTPX (async mode) – concurrent HTTP/HTTPS requests, HTTP/2 support
    scrapingant.com
    .

    HTML parsing: BeautifulSoup (with lxml parser) – simplicity and robust parsing
    medium.com
    . Use lxml directly if XPath needed.

    JS Rendering: Playwright for Python – headless Chromium/Firefox with async support. Offers modern features (auto-wait, intercept) and is faster than Selenium
    scrapfly.io
    scrapfly.io
    .

    API Framework: FastAPI – high-performance, async, easy model validation
    fastapi.tiangolo.com
    medium.com
    .

    Server: Uvicorn (ASGI server).

    CLI Framework: Typer or Click – modern CLI with type hints.

    Concurrency: asyncio (with async/await) plus concurrent.futures or thread pool if mixing sync code. Possibly Celery or RQ if a full message broker approach is desired, but simpler in-memory queue often suffices for local use.

    Data Storage: Local filesystem (JSON files) for results; in-memory dict or lightweight DB (SQLite) for job metadata.

    Dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, beautifulsoup4, playwright (and its browsers), typer or click, etc.

This stack balances ease of development with performance. FastAPI + HTTPX enables a scalable non-blocking API
fastapi.tiangolo.com

. BeautifulSoup and lxml ensure reliable parsing
medium.com
. Playwright adds support for any site with JS (which Scrapy/Requests cannot handle)
medium.com
scrapfly.io
.
5.2 Implementation Plan

    Scaffold the Project: Create a Git repo, set up a Python virtualenv, and install dependencies (fastapi[all], uvicorn, httpx, beautifulsoup4, playwright, typer, etc). Install Playwright browsers (playwright install chromium).

    CLI Module: Implement mcp_scraper.py using Typer or Click. Define commands/options: --url, --list-file, --output-dir. Include helper functions to load URLs from JSON/CSV. Test with example <EXAMPLE_URL>.

    Scraping Logic: Write a core scraper function scrape_url(url, output_path) that fetches a page and extracts data. Initially, use HTTPX + BeautifulSoup to collect raw data. For JS-heavy sites, create an alternative function scrape_js_url(url) using Playwright (e.g., async_playwright). Ensure scrape_url handles errors and returns a Python dict or list of data.

    Result Formatting: Define the JSON schema for results. After scraping, wrap results with metadata (job_id, timestamp, status) and write to <OUTPUT_DIR>/<job_id>.json.

    Job Queue: Choose a concurrency model. A simple approach is to use FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks or an asyncio.Queue plus a dedicated loop. For illustration, implement a basic in-memory queue: on job submit, create an asyncio.Task to run the scrape in background, or use concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor for blocking tasks. Keep a global dict jobs[job_id] with status info.

    FastAPI Endpoints: Build FastAPI routes:

        POST /scrape: uses Pydantic model, enqueues job.

        GET /status/{job_id}: returns status from jobs dict.

        GET /results/{job_id}: streams the JSON result file if exists.

        GET /jobs: returns a list of all jobs.
        Use BackgroundTasks.add_task() or manual task creation to start jobs without blocking the POST response.

    Testing & Examples: Test CLI and API against the demo site (quotes.toscrape.com). Verify that scraping yields the expected data (quotes, authors, tags). Use the provided sample input files (inputs/urls.json, inputs/urls.csv) for batch mode tests.

    Documentation: Write a README.md covering installation, CLI usage (as shown in specs), and API examples (cURL commands). Include notes on configuration, dependencies, and examples of expected output.

    Error Handling & Logging: Integrate exception catching around network calls. Log to console or file. Return meaningful errors via API (e.g. 400 for bad input, 500 for server error).

    Final Review: Ensure code is modular (e.g. scraper logic separate from interface). Comment and document functions. Create any necessary unit tests if time allows.

5.3 Code Snippets

Below are minimal illustrative examples. Extended code belongs in appendices or docs.

    CLI (Typer) Example:

# mcp_scraper.py
import typer
from typing import Optional

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def scrape(url: Optional[str] = typer.Option(None),
           list_file: Optional[str] = typer.Option(None),
           output_dir: str = typer.Option("./scrapes_out")):
    if url:
        targets = [url]
    elif list_file:
        import json, csv
        if list_file.endswith('.json'):
            targets = [entry["url"] for entry in json.load(open(list_file))]
        else:
            reader = csv.DictReader(open(list_file))
            targets = [row["url"] for row in reader]
    else:
        typer.echo("Error: provide --url or --list-file", err=True)
        raise typer.Exit(code=1)

    for target_url in targets:
        # Call scraping logic (possibly asynchronous)
        data = scrape_url(target_url)  # define this function separately
        job_id = save_result(data, output_dir)
        typer.echo(f"Job {job_id} completed, output in {output_dir}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()

This shows parsing inputs and iterating over URLs. The scrape_url function would perform the actual fetch/parse.

FastAPI Endpoint Example:

# main.py (FastAPI app)
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from pydantic import BaseModel
import uuid

app = FastAPI()

jobs = {}  # In-memory store: job_id -> status/info

class ScrapeRequest(BaseModel):
    input_type: str  # "url" or "file"
    target: str
    output_dir: str

@app.post("/scrape")
async def submit_scrape(req: ScrapeRequest, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    job_id = uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]
    jobs[job_id] = {"status": "queued", "target": req.target}
    # Background job
    background_tasks.add_task(run_scrape_job, job_id, req.input_type, req.target, req.output_dir)
    return {"job_id": job_id, "status": "queued"}

@app.get("/status/{job_id}")
async def get_status(job_id: str):
    job = jobs.get(job_id)
    if not job:
        return {"error": "Job not found"}
    return {"job_id": job_id, "status": job["status"]}

# ... Additional endpoints (results, jobs) omitted for brevity ...

Here run_scrape_job would update jobs[job_id]["status"] to "running" and then "completed" after finishing the scrape. This demonstrates non-blocking job scheduling.

Async Scraping with HTTPX and BeautifulSoup:

import httpx
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import asyncio

async def fetch_page(url):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10.0) as client:
        res = await client.get(url)
        res.raise_for_status()
        return res.text

async def scrape_url_async(url):
    html = await fetch_page(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')
    # Example extraction from quotes.toscrape.com:
    quotes = []
    for q in soup.select(".quote"):
        text = q.select_one(".text").get_text()
        author = q.select_one(".author").get_text()
        tags = [t.get_text() for t in q.select(".tag")]
        quotes.append({"quote": text, "author": author, "tags": tags})
    return quotes

# Run example
asyncio.run(scrape_url_async("<EXAMPLE_URL>"))

This snippet fetches a page and parses its content asynchronously.

Playwright for JS Pages:

    from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

    async def scrape_dynamic(url):
        async with async_playwright() as pw:
            browser = await pw.chromium.launch(headless=True)
            page = await browser.new_page()
            await page.goto(url, wait_until='networkidle')
            content = await page.content()
            await browser.close()
        # Parse content with BeautifulSoup or other
        soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'lxml')
        # ...extract data...
        return soup

    # Example usage:
    # asyncio.run(scrape_dynamic("https://example.com/js-page"))

    Playwright allows rendering JavaScript before extracting data, as recommended for dynamic content
    medium.com
    scrapfly.io
    .

6. Appendices
A. Example API Calls

Below are example curl calls (assuming the server runs on localhost:8000):

    Submit a Scrape Job:

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scrape" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "input_type": "url",
           "target": "https://quotes.toscrape.com/",
           "output_dir": "./scrapes_out"
         }'
# → {"job_id": "9b5328c8", "status": "queued"}

Check Job Status:

curl "http://localhost:8000/status/9b5328c8"
# → {"job_id": "9b5328c8", "status": "completed"}

Retrieve Results (Download JSON):

curl -O "http://localhost:8000/results/9b5328c8"
# Downloads the file result.json for job_id 9b5328c8

List Recent Jobs:

    curl "http://localhost:8000/jobs"
    # → [{"job_id":"9b5328c8","status":"completed","source_url":"https://...","timestamp":"...Z"}, ...]

B. Sample Input Files

These are example inputs illustrating the list-file format.
